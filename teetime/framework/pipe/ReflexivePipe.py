# Represents an unsynchronized pipe with a capacity of 1. In contrast to the:@link UnsynchedPipe}, this pipe does not execute its successor stage if an element has
# been added. This pipe has only rare application scenarios. Its main purpose is to connect an output port and an input port of the same stage.
