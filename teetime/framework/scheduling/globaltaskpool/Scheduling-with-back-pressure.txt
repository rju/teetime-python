[Example configuration]

	  ->C->D-
A->B-|		 |->G->H
	  ->E->F-

[Priorities (low=small number, high=large number) for back-pressure]
A:0
B:1
C:2
D:3
E:2
F:3
G:4
H:5

[Approach with a single thread]
#executions: 2

new front stages: 
new (thread 0) queue: A
----------------------------------- start
thread 0: execute A
thread 0: add successor B
new (thread 0) queue: B
thread 0: execute B (round-robin)
thread 0: add successor C
thread 0: add successor E
new (thread 0) queue: C,E
thread 0: execute C
----------------------------------- with back-pressure
thread 0: add successor D to front
new (thread 0) queue: D,E
thread 0: execute D
thread 0: add successor G to front
new (thread 0) queue: G,E
thread 0: execute G (round-robin)
thread 0: waits for the second input port (either via blocking or busy-waiting)

thread 0: add successor H to front
new (thread 0) queue: H,E
